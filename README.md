### About Me
I'm interested in the intersection of math and programming. I'm particularly interested in abstract algebra, type theory, graph theory, and category theory and how they can be applied practically to solve difficult problems in programming. There is a vast wealth of work already done by mathematicians, and all too often programmers reinvent the wheel in less precise terms, introducing bugs along the way. You can see some examples of how abstractions from these subjects can be applied practically in my repos, such as my [Rubik's cube solver](https://github.com/pnotequalnp/rubiks.idr) and [comonadic game of life implementation](https://github.com/pnotequalnp/game-of-life).

I'm a big fan of making the computer work for me. As such I have great interest in languages like Haskell, Idris 2, and Rust, which provide facilities to eliminate large classes of programmer error automatically, as well as mechanisms for writing highly generic code that can be applied in a surprising number of situations. I am also an avid Nix user, because dealing with dependencies shouldn't be difficult in ${current_year}.

### Other Interests
Besides math and programming, I also play the piano, French horn, chess, and go, and also cook, solve twisty puzzles, and study foreign languages. I have also recently picked up an interest in Lojban. I sometimes write software related to these topics in my free time.
