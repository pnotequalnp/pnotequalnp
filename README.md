### About Me
I'm a senior in university, studying math and CS. I'm particularly interested in abstract algebra, type theory, graph theory, and category theory and how they can be applied practically to solve difficult problems in programming. I feel pretty comfortable writing code in a variety of languages, and always love learning more. I daily drive Linux. I'm currently using NixOS, which has been working fantastically. My preferred editor is Emacs.

### Current Work
I'm mostly focusing on graduating currently, but in my free time I am learning Haskell and discovering the complex world of devops.

### Interests
Besides math and programming, I also have a music minor, play chess, cook, and solve Rubik's cube style puzzles. My primary instrument is the French horn, but I'm also slowly learning the piano. I also love learning foreign languages (though I'm not very far as of yet).
